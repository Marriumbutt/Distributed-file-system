GFS (Google File System) Simulation
This project simulates a basic version of the Google File System (GFS), which is a scalable distributed file system for large distributed data-intensive applications. The codebase includes a master server, chunkservers, and a client to interact with the file system. The implementation focuses on core functionalities such as file storage, chunk allocation, reading, and writing of data, with replication of chunks across multiple chunkservers.
